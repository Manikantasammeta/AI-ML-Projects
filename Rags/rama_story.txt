Lord Rama was the eldest son of King Dasharatha of Ayodhya and Queen Kaushalya. 
He was known for his virtue, strength, and righteousness. Dasharatha had three wives: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. 
Rama had three brothers: Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna. Among them, Rama and Lakshmana were especially close.

One day, the sage Vishwamitra came to Ayodhya and asked for Rama’s help to defeat demons that were disturbing his rituals. 
Rama and Lakshmana went with him, and they defeated the demons with great courage. On their way back, they passed through the kingdom of Mithila, 
where King Janaka had arranged a swayamvara for his daughter, Sita. Rama broke the bow of Lord Shiva and won Sita’s hand in marriage.

Rama and Sita returned to Ayodhya and lived happily. However, Dasharatha’s second wife Kaikeyi demanded that her son Bharata be made king, 
and Rama be exiled for 14 years. Obeying his father’s promise, Rama went into the forest with Sita and Lakshmana.

In the forest, they faced many challenges. One day, the demoness Shurpanakha tried to attack Sita, and Lakshmana cut off her nose. 
Enraged, she went to her brother Ravana, the mighty king of Lanka. Ravana kidnapped Sita and took her to Lanka.

Rama, with the help of the monkey king Sugriva and the mighty Hanuman, built an army to rescue Sita. Hanuman flew to Lanka, found Sita in Ashok Vatika, 
and gave her Rama’s ring. Rama’s army built a bridge over the ocean to reach Lanka. A fierce battle followed, and Rama finally defeated Ravana and rescued Sita.

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana returned to Ayodhya, and Rama was crowned king. His rule, known as Ram Rajya, was a time of peace and prosperity.
